# Rice AI – Rice Leaf Disease Detection & Farmer Assistant

Rice AI is an AI powered agricultural assistance platform that helps farmers identify rice leaf diseases from images and receive evidence based recommendations through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot.

The system combines computer vision, deep learning, and large language models to support disease diagnosis and agricultural knowledge retrieval.
